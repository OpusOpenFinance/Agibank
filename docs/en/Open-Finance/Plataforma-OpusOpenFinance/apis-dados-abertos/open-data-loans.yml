            Percentage that corresponds to the median of the pre-fixed rate charged from the customer for contracting credit, in the informed interval.
            Ex: 0.087000 = 8.7%. In cases of purely post-fixed products, ranges 1, 2, 3 and 4 must receive the value 0.000000 (zero).
            In this case, customers/rate must be represented with 1.000000, that is, 100%.
            The calculation can occur with up to 6 decimal places. The filling must respect the 6 decimal places, even if they are filled with zeros (percentage representation e.g.: 0.150000. This value represents 15%. The value 1.000000 represents 100%).
