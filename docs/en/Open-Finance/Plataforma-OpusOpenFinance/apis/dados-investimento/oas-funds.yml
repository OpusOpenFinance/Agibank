    Open Finance Brasil Investment Funds Operations API â€“ Phase 4.
    API that returns investment operation information of the Investment Funds type maintained by transmitting institutions for their clients, including data such as product information, quantity, balances in the client's position, and financial transactions.
    It does not have segregation between natural and legal persons.
    All investment funds classified as: Fixed Income, Equities, Multi-Market, and Foreign Exchange should be considered within the scope of exposure.
    For product and client position identification, the exposure will be consolidated by Investment Fund.
    For transactions, the exposure will be given by the Client Order, for example, a Redemption Order is shared as a single transaction, even if it is associated with different Certificates (Precautions).

    Institutions may present different scenarios regarding the synchronism between position `/balances` and transaction `/transactions` and `/transactions-current` API:

    - Some institutions reflect transactions not yet converted in the client's position in their electronic channels. This implies that sharing of updated position may occur, whose related transactions will be exposed in the ecosystem only after their conversion;

    - Other institutions reflect in the position only transactions converted in their electronic channels. This implies that the sharing of the position in relation to transactions is done synchronously in the ecosystem.

    For the investment identifier (investmentId), the following behavior should be adopted:

    - After 12 months without transactions and with zero asset quantity, the resourceId corresponding to the investmentId in question must change to UNAVAILABLE status (considering valid consent);

    - In situations where the client buys the asset again after a period of 12 months without transactions and with zero asset quantity, the same identifier (investmentId) must be used. Specifically for such products, the resource status in resources must change from UNAVAILABLE to AVAILABLE.
