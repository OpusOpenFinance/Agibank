  description: |
    Open Finance Brasil Treasury Bonds (Tesouro Direto) Operations API - Phase 4.
    API that returns information on Treasury Bonds (Tesouro Direto) investment operations held at
    transmitting institutions by their clients, including data such as product information, quantity,
    customer position balances and financial transactions. There is no segregation between natural and legal persons.
    All bonds offered by Tesouro Direto must be considered as the scope of exposure.
    Exposure will be given for each Treasury Bonds (Tesouro Direto) operation contracted by the client.
    Note 1: In Brazil, government bonds are known as 'Tesouro Direto'. This is an online platform where individuals can
            invest in government bonds. This API is specifically designed to work with this type of investment. 
    Note 2: The official Open Finance Brasil Team made a translation error for this concept.  Due to a false cognate, it
            was literally translated as 'Direct Title' or 'Treasure Direct Title'. Consequently, some API element names
            reflect this error. For example, names like 'treasureTitlesGetInvestments' should be understood as
            'treasuryBondsGetInvestments'.
