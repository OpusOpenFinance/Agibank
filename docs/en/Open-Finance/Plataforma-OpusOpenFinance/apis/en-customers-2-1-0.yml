        Savings account - was created to encourage people to save. Money that remains in the account for thirty days starts to generate income, with income tax exemption for those who declare. That is, the money "grows" (yields) while it is kept in the account. Each deposit will have monthly income, always on the day of the month in which the money was deposited.

        Prepaid payment account - according to CIRCULAR Nº 3.680, BCB of 2013, it is 'intended for the execution of payment transactions in electronic currency carried out based on funds denominated in reais previously contributed'.
